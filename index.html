<h2>Hello there! I'm Mitch Harrelson</h2>
<p>I am a software engineer from Hazlehurst, Ga.
a very big city, but I love it all the same.
I'm a former factory worker, so I'm used to a bit of hard work.</p>
<p>I am interested in:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Learning to create and manage websites.</li>
   <li>Soaking up code like a sponge.</li>
   <li>Working with like-minded individuals.</li>
   <li>Being able to support others.</li>
</ul>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a happily married man with 3 childred.
                since I've graduated highschool, I've mostly worked in factories
                or other odd end jobs. It doesn't matter what kind of work I've
                done, I always give 100%. I strive to learn and accumulate as much
                knowledge i can. Coding is no exception and I will deliver quality content.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy listening to music and playing video games as some of my other hobbies.
                I play guitar as well, which started from my love of music.
